# Design Toolkit for Danish Christmas Hearts 
The Danish Christmas Heart is a traditional Christmas tree ornament that many use to symbolize Danish culture and togetherness. These weaveable hearts are typically designed to be handcrafted together with loved ones during the winter holiday season. We have created a toolkit to help users make custom designs with various pattern types for Christmas Heart weaves.

Note: This toolkit uses SVG manipulation as part of its algorithm. However, we found a surprising lack of support in this area from related libraries. In the VectorAlgoUtils.py file we created some helper methods that allow for transformation actions such as rotating, translating (both 'to' and 'by' x,y), mirroring (over both the x-axis and y-axis), cropping, and resizing. These could be treated as their own library for SVG support.
